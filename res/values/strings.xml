        <b>Instructions</b>\n\n

To play, create a game or join an existing one. A server is required to play the
online game <i>and it is not provided by Nokia</i>. See the documentation in
GitHub (link available on about page) how to set up the server.\n\n

If the app does not find the server, the game will function in offline mode:
When a game is created, the virtual opponent, <i>WIMP</i>, will start to
advance towards your flag.\n\n

To have more than one person per team you need to purchase the premium version
but don\'t worry; since this is an example application, the premium version is
free or charge.

        <b>Version 1.0</b>\n\n

Capture the Flag is a Nokia example application demonstrating the use
of Nokia services on Nokia X software platform: HERE Maps, Nokia Notifications
and Nokia In-App Payment.\n\n

The app itself is based on the traditional outdoor game where two teams each
have their own flags, which the opposing team then tries to capture. The flags
in the game are randomly placed on the map within a fixed distance of the player
creating the game. The team who manages to get to the flag of the opposing team
first wins.\n\n

This demo application is hosted in GitHub where you can find the
source code and documentation of the latest release:
