        <b>Instructions</b>\n\nTo play, create a game or join an existing one. A
server is required to play the online game <i>and it is not provided by
Microsoft</i>. See the documentation in GitHub (link available on about page)
how to set up the server.\n\nIf the app does not find the server, the game will
function in offline mode: When a game is created, the virtual opponent,
<i>WIMP</i>, will start to advance towards your flag.\n\nTo have more than one
person per team you need to purchase the premium version but don\'t worry; since
this is an example application, the premium version is free or charge.

    <string name="about_text">
        <b>Version 2.0</b>\n\nCapture the Flag is a sample application
demonstrating the use of Nokia X services on Nokia X software platform: HERE
Maps, Nokia Notifications and Nokia In-App Payment. The application also
implements the corresponding Google APIs and utilises them when the same APK
file is installed on a Google services enabled phone. The detection of services
is done run-time. OpenIAB is used to implement the in-app payment
feature.\n\nThe app itself is based on the traditional outdoor game where two
teams each have their own flags, which the opposing team then tries to capture.
The flags in the game are randomly placed on the map within a fixed distance of
the player creating the game. The team who manages to get to the flag of the
opposing team first wins.\n\nThis demo application is hosted in GitHub where you
can find the source code and documentation of the latest release:\n
