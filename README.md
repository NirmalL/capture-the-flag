Capture the Flag
================

Capture the Flag is a Nokia example application demonstrating the use of Nokia
services on Nokia X software platform: HERE Maps, Nokia Notifications and Nokia
In-App Payment.

The app itself is based on the traditional outdoor game where two teams each
have their own flags, which the opposing team then tries to capture. The flags
in the game are randomly placed on the map within a fixed distance of the
player creating the game. The team who manages to get to the flag of the
opposing team first wins.
