## Push Notifications

__<< TODO: Insert class diagram >>__

### Usage

The game uses push notifications for sending a message from the game server to all game clients when a flag is captured and the game ends. For push notifications, the game uses **Nokia Notifications** on **Nokia X** platform and **Google Cloud Notifications** (**GCN**) on **Android** devices.

Receiving push notifications requires adding the necessary permissions and declaring broadcast receivers for both types of push notifications to the application's manifest file.

Push notification implementation on the client application-side consists of two parts:

- Registering application for push notifications
- Receiving and handling of push notifications

Push notification registration is done through the `NotificationsManagerInterface` which encapsulates the platform-specific registration implementation. Push notifications on both platforms are received and handled through `BroadcastReceiver`s.

### NotificationsManagerInterface

The `NotificationsManagerInterface` interface declares the following methods:

- `void register()`

	Registers the application for push notifications and stores the registration id for later use. Uses existing registration id if available. 

- `String getRegistrationId()`

	Returns the push notification registration id for the application.

- `NotificationServiceType getServiceType()`

	Returns the push notification service type in use: `NotificationServiceType.NOKIA_NOTIFICATIONS` on **Nokia X** platform, `NotificationServiceType.GOOGLE_CLOUD_MESSAGING` on **Android** devices.

- `void onDestroy()`

	Releases any allocated push notification resources.
 

### Registering for push notifications

The `Controller`, on its creation, registers the game to the platform specific push notification mechanism (**Nokia Notifications** or **GCM**) for receiving push notifications by getting the notifications manager singleton instance implementing the `NotificationsManagerInterface` interface by calling `NotificationsManagerFactory.getInstance(Context context)` and then the `register()` method declared in the interface.

The register() method checks whether the application has an existing registration id for receiving push notifications. If an id exists the applications uses it, otherwise a new registration id will be obtained. For **Nokia Notifications** storing the registration id is handled automatically by `com.nokia.push.PushRegistrar` but for **GCM** the application has to handle storing the registration id by itself. The game uses `android.preference.PreferenceManager` for that. 

The registration id, along with information about the platform the game is running on (**Nokia X** or **Google Android**), is then sent to the game server when the player either starts a new game (see `CreateGameFragment`) or joins an existing game (see `JoinGameFragment`). The game server uses the platform information and registration id to send push notification messages for that particular application instance using either the **Nokia Notifications Service API** or **GCM Connection Server**.

When the `Controller` is destroyed it calls the `onDestroy()` method of the `NotificationsManagerInterface` to release any push notification related allocated resources.

### Receiving push notifications

The declared receiver implementations, for **Nokia Notifications** the `NokiaNotificationsBroadcastReceiver` and for **GCM** the `GcmBroadcastReceiver`, will then receive the push notifications and pass them on to the corresponding intent services for handling. The `NokiaNotificationsIntentService` and `GcmIntentService` will then handle the push notification intent by using `NotificationsUtils.broadcastGameMessage(String message, Context context)` to broadcast the received message locally inside the application.

The `Controller` in its `onResume()` registers and in `onPause()` unregisters a `BroadcastReceiver mPushHandler` for receiving the local broadcast messages. The `mPushHandler`, when receiving an `Intent`, parses the broadcasted message into a Player data for flag capturer and displays the `GameEndedDialogFragment` and ends the current game.

### Server-side push notification implementation

When the example game server detects that a player has captured the other team's flag it notifies all the players in the game using push notifications that the game has ended.

The server groups the connected players into groups based on the player's platform information (either "nokia" or "google"), see `sendPushNotification()` in `utils.js`, and uses the **Nokia Notifications Service API** to send a push message to all players using **Nokia X** platform devices and **GCM Connection Server** to send the same push message to players using **Android** devices.

**Nokia Notifications Service API** usage is implemented in the `sendNokiaNotifications(players, payload)` function. For **GCM** message sending the example server uses `node-gcm` module which is used in `sendGoogleNotifications(players, payload)`.
